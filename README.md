# 📚 Textbook Comparison Bot

**Textbook Comparison Bot** is a user-friendly Streamlit web application that enables users to compare two textbooks (PDFs) based on various criteria. This tool leverages advanced natural language processing (NLP) through Google's Gemini Pro model to provide in-depth analysis and comparisons between the selected textbooks, helping users make informed decisions about their learning materials.

## 🚀 Features

- **Topic Coverage Comparison:** Analyze the topics covered in both textbooks and compare them side by side.
- **Clarity & Accuracy Analysis:** Assess how clearly and accurately each textbook presents its content.
- **Depth of Coverage:** Evaluate the depth of the material covered, including how well concepts are explained.
- **Usefulness for Learning:** Understand which textbook offers more value for learning purposes.
- **Additional Insights:** Gain deeper insights such as examples, case studies, or real-world applications provided by the textbooks.
- **Natural Language Processing:** Powered by Google's Gemini Pro NLP model for detailed, accurate comparisons.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Streamlit:** Fast, interactive web interface.
- **Python:** Core programming language.
- **Google Gemini Pro Model:** For powerful natural language processing and textbook analysis.
- **PyPDF2:** For extracting text from PDF files.
- **pandas:** Data manipulation and analysis.
- **MongoDB:** For storing and retrieving user interaction data (optional, if needed).
