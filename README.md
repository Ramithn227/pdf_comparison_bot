The Textbook Comparison Bot is a Streamlit web application that allows users to compare two textbooks (PDFs) based on various criteria such as topics covered, clarity, accuracy, depth of coverage, usefulness for learning, additional insights, and more. The bot utilizes Google's Gemini Pro model for natural language processing and generates a detailed comparison between the two textbooks.
